Sharing notes for different courses

## How to submit/commit notes

for absoulute beginners to github 

In the main directory `note-share/` create a new folder with the EXACT course name (if it doesn't exist already).

Inside of those main course folders will be two folders one for smester 1 & 2.

This is the most imporant part of this guide. Inside of those folders are the notes, PLEASE use the following naming scheme for the files. To get the names use powerschool just copy and paste. And for the assignment name/number get it from canvas. The naming scheme is as follows:

`name of teacher` __ `name of course` __ `assignment name/number` __ `date in mm/dd/yyyy format` 

Make sure you use double undersocres (this makes it easier to read)
Here is an example:

Smith, John__Pre IB Honors Geometery__Doing things with cubes 3.2.1__04/06/2022.docx

This makes it possible to easily find the assignment notes with either the date or the name/number of the assignment.
